### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-time software engineer. Mostly, I work with javascript (react) and php. In my free time, I like to work with some random stuff such as [gqlpen](https://github.com/azmy60/gqlpen), and [simple-video-editor](https://github.com/azmy60/simple-video-editor).

I do love to explore UI engineering, backends, and rust (still learning though..)! And I'm very interested to developing non-final products like libraries and frameworks.
